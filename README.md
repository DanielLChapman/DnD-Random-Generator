DnD-Random-Generator
====================

Generates a random event based on location and CR level

Currently still being worked on,

No ability to delete names without going through text file.
Text file is disorganized.
Would be better with a centralized database, will work to make that but for now this satisfies what we need.
Potential error with more then 20 creatures added but thats just a number I need to fix, wanted to implement the
random functionality before expanding it. 

With a database most of this functionality will be gone so that was another reason I didnt try to fix the obvious 20
creature bug. 


Also need to add functionality for CR and Type constraints.
